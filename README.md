# 100 Day Starter Kit

Aaron Engelberg, 2018

Translation of AutismSpeaks 100-day starter kit from English into French.

###### Preface:
We are translating a 100-day "starter kit" for families who have a child who just recieved an autism spectrum diagnosis, from English to French. There are about 100 pages of the document that have been automatically Google translated and we need your help editing the final copies. Put your French skills to the test and beat Google Translate! Everyone who finishes 1 edited page will recieve a Connect project sticker. And the Top 3 editors will recieve a **25€ gift card *of their choice.*** Thank you for your help connecting people with disabilities to resources they need!

###### Instructions:
Every page of the translated document is in a separate file in the <>Code section of github. Each corresponding page has an issue associated with it saying 'Page # - Translation Edit'.
  1) Click on Issues and find a page that still has an issue attached to it
  *Note- if a page does not have an issue, that means that it is already edited and does not need to be edited again*
  2) Find the corresponding translation in <>Code and click the little pen in the upper righthand corner to edit the document.
  *Don't edit any .md formatting code, these are just there to make the text formatted once you click 'Preview Changes'*
  3) We are trying to make the writing as inclusive as possible so please include both masculine and feminine subjects when possible! See page 21 for an example.
  4) If you want to review the original English, find the corresponding pages in the English folder.
  5) Once edited, review the changes by clicking 'Preview changes' where you can see the formatting and the changes you've made.
  6) Comment on the issue that you have edited that page. I will then 'close' the issue and that page will be finished.
  *It would be amazing to know where and who is editing so please add your name and City/Country in the issue comment!*
  
*Note: This guide is intended to be used by French people so it requires more than just basic translation. Laws, culture, and educational practices also need to be made accurate and pertinent for French people. As such, if you see something that is false or inapplicable for France, please let us know in the comments of the issue.*

###### Prizes: 
Every person who edits one page will recieve a signature, premium, designed Connect project sticker! Contact me at aaron.engelberg@cri-paris.org for your sticker. You get a sticker! You get a sticker! Everybody gets STICKERS (after completing the translation)!!!!!
Those who have translated the **Top 3 Most Pages** will recieve a 25€ gift card to a website *of their choice.* And please, feel free to share with anyone who is bilingual and would like to contribute!

###### Thank you, and let the games begin!
